=============

## Makers Academy - 3 day Group Project

A web app that lets hosts offer up a list of spaces to rent and lets renters rent them out

```
As a host
So that I can rent out a space
I would like to list a space

As a host
So that I can rent out all my spaces
I would like to list more than one space

As a host
So that I can track different spaces
I would like to give each listing a name

As a host
So that I can encourage uptake of my space
I would like to describe my space

As a host
So that I can charge customers 
I would like to list a price per night

As a host 
So my space can be rented as much as possible
I would like to be able to offer a range of dates for when the space is available

As a renter
So that I can have somewhere to sleep
I would like to be able request to hire a space

As a host
So that I can vet people 
I would like to be able to approve a renter's request

As a renter
So I know when a space is unavailable
I would like to not be able to book that space

As a host 
So that my space can be rented as long as possible
I would like spaces to be available until booking is confirmed
